# Test Document for RAG System

## Introduction to Gloria Mundo

Gloria Mundo is an advanced AI assistant that combines the best of multiple AI models with the ability to access and reference uploaded documents. This retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capability allows Gloria Mundo to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-model Support**: Gloria Mundo can switch between different AI models based on the task at hand.
2. **Document Processing**: Users can upload documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) which are processed and stored for reference.
3. **Context-Aware Responses**: When answering questions, Gloria Mundo can pull relevant information from uploaded documents.
4. **Memory Retention**: Within a conversation, Gloria Mundo maintains chat history regardless of which AI model is being used.

## Technical Implementation

The RAG system works through these components:
- Document chunking: Large documents are split into manageable chunks
- Embedding generation: Each chunk is converted into a vector representation
- Similarity search: When a question is asked, the system finds chunks with similar semantic meaning
- Context integration: Relevant chunks are provided to the AI model as additional context

## Sample Use Cases

1. Summarizing research papers
2. Answering specific questions about uploaded manuals or guides
3. Extracting insights from complex documents
4. Analyzing and comparing information across multiple documents

## Important Information for Testing

The secret code for validating this RAG system is: "GLORIA-RAG-2025".

If you see this information in a response, it means the document retrieval system is working correctly.
