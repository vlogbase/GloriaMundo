Hello again. Thank you for the previous updates â€“ the "New Chat" button and the model/token display formatting look much better now, as seen in the latest screenshot (`image_f3383f.png`).

However, the original bug persists: **The very first message a user ever sends in the application still doesn't display correctly.** The AI's reply *does* appear, but the user's initiating message is missing (or its display is somehow broken/delayed). This only happens for the absolute first interaction; all subsequent messages, including the first message in later new chats, work fine.

Your previous attempt involved editing `useChat.ts` and `Chat.tsx`, which seemed like the right places, but it didn't resolve the core issue. Let's try again, focusing on potential causes specific to the "first-ever" scenario:

Please reinvestigate and fix this bug, paying close attention to these possibilities:

1.  **Initialization Timing / Race Conditions:**
    * Could there be a race condition between the initialization of the `useChat.ts` hook (or the state it manages) and the execution of the `handleSendMessage` function in `Chat.tsx` when it's triggered for the very first time?
    * Is the message state fully ready and available *before* the attempt to add the first user message?

2.  **State Update Logic (First Message Specific):**
    * Examine exactly how the first user message is added to the message list state within `useChat.ts`. Is the logic robust enough for the initial empty state? If using functional updates (e.g., `setMessages(prevMessages => ...)`), ensure it handles an initially undefined or empty `prevMessages` correctly.

3.  **Initial Conversation Creation:**
    * When `handleSendMessage` runs for the first time ever, it likely also triggers the creation of the *very first conversation object*. Is this new conversation object, including its internal message list, being created and updated correctly? Is the first user message successfully added *to this newly created conversation's message list* immediately?

4.  **Asynchronous Flow:**
    * Review the async flow: (1) Optimistically adding user message to UI state -> (2) Sending API request -> (3) Adding AI response to UI state. Is there a subtle error in promise handling or state updates related to this sequence that *only* manifests during the very first run?

**Debugging Action Plan:**

* **Add Detailed Logging (Temporary):** To pinpoint the failure, please add `console.log` statements at critical points:
    * In `useChat.ts`: Log when the hook initializes. Log the message list state *immediately before* attempting to add the first user message. Log the message list state *immediately after* attempting to add the first user message. Log the state again after the AI response is added.
    * In `handleSendMessage` (in `Chat.tsx` or wherever it lives): Log when it's called for the first time. Log the content of the message being added.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Use an incognito window or clear application storage (local storage, etc.) to reliably simulate a first-time user experience and trigger the bug. Observe the console logs carefully to see where the state update fails or behaves unexpectedly for the first message.
* **Implement the Fix:** Based on the log analysis, apply the necessary code changes to ensure the first user message is reliably added to the state and rendered.
* **Clean Up:** Remove the temporary `console.log` statements once the bug is fixed.

The goal is to ensure the user's very first message appears correctly in the chat interface alongside the AI's response, just like all subsequent messages do.
