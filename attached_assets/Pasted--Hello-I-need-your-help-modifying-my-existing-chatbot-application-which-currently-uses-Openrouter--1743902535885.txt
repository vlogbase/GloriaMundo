"Hello! I need your help modifying my existing chatbot application, which currently uses Openrouter for generating responses. Right now, the app waits for the entire response from the Openrouter API before displaying it. I want to change this to implement streaming, so the response appears chunk-by-chunk in the UI as soon as it's generated by the model.

Why we're doing this:

Better User Experience: Streaming makes the chatbot feel much more responsive and interactive, as users see text appearing almost immediately instead of waiting.
Handling Long Responses: It provides immediate feedback even for potentially long generations.
How Openrouter Streaming Works:

stream: true Parameter: To enable streaming, the API request made to Openrouter's /chat/completions endpoint needs to include the parameter "stream": true in its JSON body.
Server-Sent Events (SSE): When stream: true is set, the API doesn't return a single JSON response. Instead, it sends back a stream of Server-Sent Events (SSE) over the same HTTP connection.
SSE Message Format: Each event in the stream typically looks like data: {...JSON payload...}\n\n.
Delta Chunks: The JSON payload within the data: field for ongoing text generation usually contains a choices array, where the message object has a delta field instead of message. This delta object contains the newly generated chunk of text (e.g., {"choices": [{"delta": {"content": " new text"}}]}).
End of Stream: The stream ends when Openrouter sends a specific event, typically data: [DONE]\n\n.
Specific Implementation Steps:

Please modify the current application code as follows:

Locate the API Call: Find the function or code block responsible for sending the request to the Openrouter /chat/completions API endpoint.
Modify the API Request: Add "stream": true to the JSON payload (body) being sent in that API request.
Change Response Handling: The current code likely waits for the full response and then processes it once. Replace this logic with code that handles an SSE stream:
Use a Suitable HTTP Client Method: Ensure the HTTP request method you're using supports reading a streaming response (e.g., using Workspace API in JavaScript, requests library with stream=True in Python and iterating over response.iter_lines() or response.iter_content(), or a dedicated SSE client library if available).
Iterate Over Events: Set up a loop or event listener to process incoming data chunks from the response stream as they arrive.
Parse Each Event: For each chunk received:
Check if it's the end-of-stream signal (e.g., data: [DONE]). If so, finalize the response display and break the loop/close the handler.
Check if it's a valid data event (starts with data:).
Extract the JSON string following data:.
Parse the JSON string.
Safely access the text chunk, typically located at parsed_json.choices[0].delta.content. Important: Add checks to ensure choices, delta, and content exist before accessing them, as some chunks might be empty or structured differently (e.g., for tool calls).
Update the UI: Append the extracted text chunk (delta.content) to the message area in the user interface where the chatbot's response is displayed. This needs to happen inside the loop for each chunk received. You might need to target a specific HTML element and update its content incrementally.
Handle Stream Closure and Errors: Ensure the connection is properly closed when the [DONE] signal is received or if an error occurs during the stream. Implement basic error handling for potential issues during streaming (network errors, parsing errors).
Please adapt the specifics based on the programming language (e.g., Python with Flask/FastAPI, JavaScript with Node.js/Express, or frontend JavaScript) and the HTTP libraries currently used in the project.

Let me know if you need clarification on any part of this."
