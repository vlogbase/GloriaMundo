I have now configured a performant MongoDB Atlas Vector Search index to significantly speed up the document chunk retrieval for the RAG chatbot application, replacing the previous slow method of calculating similarity in application memory.
Please update the application code based on the following index configuration and instructions:
MongoDB Atlas Vector Search Index Details:
Index Name: vector_index
Database: gloriamundo
Collection: document.chunks
Vector Field:
Path: embedding
Dimensions: 3072 (matching OpenAI model text-embedding-3-large)
Similarity: cosine
Filter Field (for Multi-User Support):
Path: userId
Required Actions:
Update Data Saving Logic:


Locate the code responsible for processing and saving document chunks to the gloriamundo.document.chunks collection (likely in server/documentProcessor.ts or similar).
Verify and ensure that the code saves the vector embeddings generated by the Azure OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model into a field named exactly embedding. This field must contain a 3072-dimension array.
Verify and ensure that the code saves the appropriate user identifier (for multi-user support) into a field named exactly userId.
If these fields (embedding, userId) are not currently being saved with these exact names or structure, modify the code to do so.
Update Data Retrieval Logic (Search Function):


Locate the function responsible for finding similar document chunks based on a query embedding (likely the findSimilarChunks function in server/documentProcessor.ts).
Replace the existing logic (which likely fetched many chunks and calculated similarity manually) with a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline that uses the $vectorSearch stage.
Construct the $vectorSearch stage using the details above. It should specify:
index: "vector_index"
path: "embedding"
queryVector: [the_embedding_vector_of_the_user_query]
numCandidates: [a_suitable_number_like_100] (adjust as needed for performance/accuracy balance)
limit: [the_number_of_results_to_return_e.g.,_5_or_10]
Crucially, include a filter parameter within $vectorSearch (or a subsequent $match stage if necessary) to restrict the search to documents where the userId field matches the ID of the user making the current request. This is essential for speed and multi-user data separation. Example filter structure: { userId: { eq: currentUserIdentifier } } (syntax might vary slightly).
Goal:
The primary goal is to leverage the new vector_index via the $vectorSearch stage for fast, database-side similarity searching, filtered by user. This should resolve the previous timeout issues and performance bottlenecks.
Please implement these changes and confirm once completed. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need clarification on the required field names or $vectorSearch syntax.
