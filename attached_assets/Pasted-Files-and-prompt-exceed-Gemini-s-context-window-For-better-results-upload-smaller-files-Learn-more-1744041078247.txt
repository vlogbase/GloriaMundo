Okay, I have examined the codebase provided in gloriamundo codebase 7 4.txt.   

The file responsible for restricting the upload types in the file selector is:

client/src/components/ChatInput.tsx    
Specifically, the <input type="file"> element has an accept attribute that limits the selectable files. Looking at the code you provided (around line 160 in the snippet for that file):   

TypeScript

// client/src/components/ChatInput.tsx
// ...
          <input
            type="file"
            ref={fileInputRef}
            multiple
            onChange={handleFileChange}
            className="hidden"
            // Add accept attribute here
            accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt" // <-- This line restricts file types
          />
// ...
Recommended Change:

To allow image uploads, you need to modify the accept attribute to include common image file types. You can use either MIME types (generally preferred) or file extensions.

Option 1 (Using MIME Types):

TypeScript

// client/src/components/ChatInput.tsx
// ...
          <input
            type="file"
            ref={fileInputRef}
            multiple
            onChange={handleFileChange}
            className="hidden"
            accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt,image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif,image/webp" // <-- Modified line
          />
// ...
Option 2 (Using File Extensions):

TypeScript

// client/src/components/ChatInput.tsx
// ...
          <input
            type="file"
            ref={fileInputRef}
            multiple
            onChange={handleFileChange}
            className="hidden"
            accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt,.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.gif,.webp" // <-- Modified line
          />
// ...
Explanation:

Modifying the accept attribute tells the browser to allow users to select files matching these types in the file picker dialog.

Important Note: While this change will allow users to select image files in the browser, ensure your backend code (likely involving server/documentProcessor.ts and server/documentRoutes.ts ) is prepared to handle these image files correctly upon upload. Since you mentioned image handling is set up, this might already be the case, but it's a crucial part of the complete workflow.
