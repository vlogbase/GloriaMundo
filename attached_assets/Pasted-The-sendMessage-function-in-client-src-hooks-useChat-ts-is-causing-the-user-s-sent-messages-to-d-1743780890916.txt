The `sendMessage` function in `client/src/hooks/useChat.ts` is causing the user's sent messages to disappear. This is because it expects the backend API (`POST /api/conversations/:id/messages`) to return a specific JSON structure (`{ userMessage: ..., assistantMessage: ... }`) which the backend is likely not providing, causing an error that removes the optimistic user message.

Please modify `client/src/hooks/useChat.ts` as follows:

1.  **Simplify User Input Handling:** Remove the block of code (around lines 100-120) that tries to parse the `content` variable as JSON. Assume the `content` passed to `sendMessage` is the plain text to be sent. The necessary `modelId` is already being handled separately.

2.  **Fix Response Handling Logic:**
    * Change the code that handles the response from the `apiRequest` call (around lines 128-137).
    * Assume the backend, upon success, returns the **assistant's message object** directly in the JSON response (or perhaps nested like `{ assistantMessage: ... }`). Adjust the parsing logic accordingly. It should *not* expect `userMessage` to be returned from this endpoint.
    * If the response is parsed successfully and contains the assistant's message data, update the state by simply **appending** the new assistant message to the existing messages array. The existing optimistic user message should remain. The logic should look something like:
      ```typescript
      // Assuming 'newAssistantMessage' is the message object parsed from the response
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, newAssistantMessage]);
      ```
      (Remove the previous `.map(...).concat(...)` logic on lines 135-137).

3.  **Adjust Error Handling:** Ensure the `catch` block (around lines 154-177) still handles errors appropriately (e.g., shows a toast message) but **verify it no longer removes the optimistic user message** unless the error specifically indicates the message *itself* failed to send (which is unlikely if the API call was attempted). Let the user message remain visible even if the assistant response fails.

Apply these changes to `client/src/hooks/useChat.ts` to ensure user messages are displayed correctly and the handling of the backend response is robust.
