Even if you've fixed the low-level SSE parsing error (SyntaxError) and are using EventSource correctly, the end result is that responses still aren’t appearing incrementally.
There could be several reasons for this discrepancy between your code being technically correct for SSE and the lack of visible streaming:
Backend Not Streaming Incrementally: Your backend (likely routes.ts in the streaming endpoint /api/conversations/:id/messages/stream) might be set up to use SSE, but still waits for the entire response from OpenRouter before sending data (or sends all data at once) over the SSE connection. You need to call res.write() for each chunk as it arrives from the OpenRouter stream.


Frontend State/Rendering Issue: The frontend code receiving the SSE events (probably in a hook like useStreamingChat.ts) might be collecting all the chunks internally and only updating the React state (and thus the UI) once the final [DONE] signal is received. You should update the UI on every chunk arrival.


Buffering: Intermediate components (like web server configurations such as Nginx, proxies, or even browser behavior) might be buffering the stream, which delays delivery and makes it appear non-streamed.



Debugging Steps for You:
To determine where the issue lies, you should:
Verify Backend Streaming: Add logging in routes.ts inside the while (true) loop of the streaming endpoint. Log just before each res.write(...) call for type: "chunk". Do the logs show chunks being sent out incrementally over time, or is there a delay before the first one is sent?


Verify Frontend Receiving: Add logging in your EventSource.onmessage handler (probably in useStreamingChat.ts or similar). Log the timestamp and content of each type: "chunk" event as soon as it's received from the backend. Do the logs appear incrementally over time in the browser console?


Verify Frontend Rendering: In the same handler, log just before and after updating the React state (e.g., setMessages) with a new chunk. Are you updating the state incrementally, or only once at the end?


Check Network Tab: Open the browser Developer Tools (F12 → Network tab), find the request to /api/conversations/.../messages/stream, and inspect the "EventStream" or "Response" tab. Are the chunks arriving one by one over time, or all at once in a block?


Can you please provide the frontend file responsible for handling the streaming events and updating the chat display? It’s likely a custom hook (e.g., useStreamingChat.ts or something similar) that uses EventSource or ReadableStream. That file would help diagnose any frontend state or rendering issues.
