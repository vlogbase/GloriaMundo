We need to correct the Model Preset UI implementation. The previous attempt incorrectly left the old model selection controls in place alongside the new preset buttons, as seen in the screenshot `image_deb0a0.png`.

Please modify the frontend code, primarily focusing on the component responsible for the chat input area (likely `client/src/components/ChatInput.tsx`), to achieve the following **exact** state:

1.  **Remove Old Controls:**
    * Find the code block rendering the `ToggleGroup` component which contains the "Reasoning", "Search", and "Multimodal" buttons. **Delete this entire code block.**
    * Find the code block rendering the "OpenRouter" text label and the associated `<select>` dropdown menu (used for basic model selection in Phase 2). **Delete this entire code block.**

2.  **Correct Placement of Presets:**
    * Ensure that the `<ModelPresets />` component (which renders the 5 preset buttons) is positioned correctly within the layout, **replacing** the elements you just removed. It should be the primary and only visible control for model selection in that specific UI area.

3.  **Verify Preset Component Functionality:**
    * Double-check that the `<ModelPresets />` component and its associated hook (`useModelPresets.tsx`):
        * Renders exactly **5** preset buttons.
        * Fetches the list of available OpenRouter models (`/api/openrouter/models`) and uses it to display the **actual model name** (e.g., "Claude 3.5 Sonnet") on each button, based on the model ID assigned to that preset slot. Do not display generic labels like "Preset 1". Handle cases where a preset might be unassigned.
        * Correctly fetches the user's saved presets (`/api/users/me/presets`) and uses the **default model IDs** if none are saved:
            * Preset 1: `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`
            * Preset 2: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`
            * Preset 3: `deepseek/deepseek-chat`
            * Preset 4: `google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest` (or correct ID)
            * Preset 5: `perplexity/sonar-medium-online` (or correct ID)
        * **Visually highlights** the preset button that corresponds to the currently active model selected for the chat session.
        * Still correctly handles left-click (activate preset) and right-click/long-press (open model assignment modal) actions.

The final UI in that section should *only* show the 5 preset buttons, correctly labeled with model names and indicating the active selection. Please confirm you have removed the old controls and verified the functionality described above. If possible, show the updated JSX code section from the parent component (`ChatInput.tsx` or similar) where the removal and placement occurred.
