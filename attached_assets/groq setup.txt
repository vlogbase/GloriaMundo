Quickstart
Get up and running with the Groq API in a few minutes.

Create an API Key
Please visit here to create an API Key.

Set up your API Key (recommended)
Configure your API key as an environment variable. This approach streamlines your API usage by eliminating the need to include your API key in each request. Moreover, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of inadvertently including your API key in your codebase.

In your terminal of choice:

export GROQ_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
Requesting your first chat completion
curl
JavaScript
Python
JSON
Install the Groq JavaScript library:

npm install --save groq-sdk
Performing a Chat Completion:

import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });

export async function main() {
  const chatCompletion = await getGroqChatCompletion();
  // Print the completion returned by the LLM.
  console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0]?.message?.content || "");
}

export async function getGroqChatCompletion() {
  return groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Explain the importance of fast language models",
      },
    ],
    model: "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  });
}
Now that you have successfully received a chat completion, you can try out the other endpoints in the API.
