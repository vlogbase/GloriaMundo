Goal: Modify the chatbot to stream responses from OpenRouter incrementally instead of displaying the full response at once.

Key Files to Modify (Likely):

Backend: The server route handling the chat request to OpenRouter (e.g., potentially within server/routes.ts or a dedicated chat handler file).
Frontend API Client: The function making the call to your backend's chat endpoint (e.g., within client/src/lib/api.ts).
Frontend Chat Hook: The hook managing chat state and interactions (e.g., client/src/hooks/useStreamingChat.ts).
Frontend Chat UI: The component rendering messages (e.g., client/src/components/ChatMessage.tsx).
Instructions:

Enable Streaming in OpenRouter Request (Backend):

Locate the code making the POST request to the OpenRouter /chat/completions endpoint.
Add the stream: true parameter to the JSON body of the request.
Ensure the OpenRouter library or HTTP client you are using supports handling streamed responses (Server-Sent Events - SSE).
Process Streamed Response (Backend):

Modify the backend route to handle the SSE stream from OpenRouter.
Instead of waiting for the full response, process each incoming chunk (event) from the stream. Each chunk typically contains a delta with new content.
Forward each relevant chunk (likely the content delta) immediately to the frontend client (e.g., using WebSockets or another SSE connection from your backend to the client).
Reasoning Tokens: Investigate how OpenRouter sends reasoning tokens in stream mode. They might be in separate events or part of the data chunks. Adapt the backend processing to identify and potentially forward these tokens separately if needed for display.
Handle Stream on Frontend (Frontend Hook/API Client):

Update the function in client/src/lib/api.ts that calls your backend chat endpoint to handle a streamed response (e.g., using the Workspace API with ReadableStream or a WebSocket client).
In client/src/hooks/useStreamingChat.ts, establish the connection to receive the streamed chunks from your backend.
As chunks arrive, update the state representing the assistant's message incrementally. Append the new content delta from each chunk to the existing message content for the current response.
Update UI for Incremental Display (Frontend UI):

Ensure the ChatMessage.tsx component (or equivalent) re-renders efficiently as the message state is updated incrementally by the hook.
If you decide to display reasoning tokens, modify the UI to show them as they arrive or after the main response stream is complete, based on how they are received.
This approach changes the flow from a single request-response cycle to a continuous stream, allowing the UI to update in real-time as the response is generated.
