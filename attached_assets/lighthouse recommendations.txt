Based on the Lighthouse report for gloriamundo.com, here are some detailed recommendations to improve your app’s performance—and by extension, its SEO:

Performance Improvements
Optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):

Current LCP: 16.2 seconds, which is far above the ideal threshold (ideally under 4 seconds).
Recommendations:
Image Optimization: Compress and resize large images, and serve them in next-generation formats like WebP or AVIF.
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images and other non-critical assets.
Preloading Critical Assets: Use <link rel="preload"> for above-the-fold images, fonts, and key CSS to reduce delay in rendering critical content.
Reduce First Contentful Paint (FCP):

Current FCP: 4.5 seconds, which is slower than desired (ideally closer to 1-2 seconds).
Recommendations:
Minify & Bundle Resources: Minify CSS and JavaScript, and use code splitting to ensure that only critical code loads first.
Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources: Audit third-party scripts and styles; defer or asynchronously load non-critical ones.
Improve Speed Index:

Current Speed Index: 4.5 seconds, indicating that the visual progress of page loading can be improved.
Recommendations:
Optimize Critical Rendering Path: Identify and prioritize the resources needed for the initial render.
Utilize Browser Caching & a CDN: Leverage caching mechanisms and a Content Delivery Network to serve resources faster to users around the globe.
