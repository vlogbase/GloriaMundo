Okay, previous attempts to fix the model selection and preset issues haven't worked. Please analyze the complete current codebase provided in `gloriamundo codebase 4 4 evening (1).txt` to diagnose and fix the following observed problems:

**Problem 1: Chat Model Does Not Change**
* **Symptom:** When I click a preset button (e.g., the one for 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet' or 'Dolphin'), the UI button might visually highlight, but subsequent chat messages sent to the backend still use an incorrect/old model ID (like `allenai/molmo-7b-d:free`) when calling the OpenRouter API.
* **Evidence:** The AI's own responses sometimes indicate it received malformed input mentioning the wrong model ID (see previous interactions/screenshots like `image_9a7593.png` and `image_9894bb.png`).
* **Goal:** Clicking a preset button should correctly update the active model ID used for subsequent chat API calls, so the selected model is actually used.

**Problem 2: Preset Saving Fails**
* **Symptom:** When I right-click a preset button, open the modal, select a model from the dropdown list, and click 'Save', a toast notification appears with the error "Failed to update preset. Please try again."
* **Goal:** Saving a model assignment to a preset slot via the modal should work correctly and update the user's saved presets without error.

**Instructions for Agent:**

1.  **Analyze:** Examine the provided codebase (`gloriamundo codebase 4 4 evening (1).txt`).
2.  **Diagnose:** Find the root causes for both Problem 1 (incorrect model usage despite preset clicks) and Problem 2 (preset saving API failure).
    * For Problem 1, focus on the state management flow: how is the active model ID set when a preset button is clicked (`ModelPresets.tsx`, `useModelPresets.tsx`, `useModelSelection.tsx`) and how is it read/used by the chat function (`useChat.ts`) when calling the backend (`server/routes.ts`)? Identify the disconnect.
    * For Problem 2, investigate the `PUT /api/user/presets` endpoint in `server/routes.ts`, the `mutate` function in `useModelPresets.tsx`, and the associated database update logic (`storage.updateUserPresets`). Why is the API call failing?
3.  **Implement Fixes:** Apply the necessary code changes across all relevant files (frontend hooks, components, backend routes, storage logic) to resolve both problems.
4.  **Confirm:** After applying the fixes, please confirm what changes were made and restart the application.

Please focus on making the preset selection reliably control the model used for chat requests and ensuring preset assignments can be saved successfully.
