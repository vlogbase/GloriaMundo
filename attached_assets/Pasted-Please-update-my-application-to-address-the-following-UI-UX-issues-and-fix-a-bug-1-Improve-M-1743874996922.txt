Please update my application to address the following UI/UX issues and fix a bug:

1.  **Improve Model & Token Usage Display:**
    * Locate the text displayed below the message action buttons (like copy/share) that shows the AI model name and token count (currently looks something like `deepseek-chat-v3-0324 free 344 out 750`).
    * Reformat this display for better readability and clarity. Consider using one of these approaches:
        * Separate the model name and token info onto two lines.
        * Use better spacing or a visual separator (like `|` or `-`) between the model name and token count.
    * Ensure the text is neatly aligned (e.g., left-aligned or centered under the buttons) and consider using a slightly less prominent style (e.g., smaller font size or lighter color) than the main chat messages.

2.  **Fix Missing First User Message Bug:**
    * There is a bug where the very *first* message a user *ever* sends in the application is not displayed in the chat interface; only the AI's reply appears.
    * This *only* happens on the absolute first message. Subsequent messages, including the first message in any *new* chat created later, display correctly (showing both the user message and the AI reply).
    * Please investigate and fix this bug. Likely areas to check include:
        * Initialization of the chat message history state.
        * The logic for adding the user's message to the displayed list upon sending.
        * Any conditional rendering logic for message bubbles that might incorrectly hide the first one.
        * Potential timing issues or race conditions during the very first message/response cycle.

3.  **Replace "New Chat" Icon:**
    * In the top-left area of the sidebar, there is currently a "+" icon used to start a new chat session.
    * Replace this "+" icon with a more explicit UI element: a button or box with rounded corners that contains the text "New Chat".
    * Ensure this new button retains the exact same functionality of starting a new chat.

Please apply these changes carefully, ensuring existing functionality (like copying messages, sending messages after the first one, etc.) remains intact.
