This is a sample text document for testing the RAG system in GloriaMundo.

The document processing system should be able to:
1. Extract text from this file
2. Split it into chunks
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store the chunks in MongoDB
5. Retrieve relevant chunks based on semantic similarity

This functionality will allow users to upload their own documents and have the AI reference these documents during conversations.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models by allowing them to access external knowledge not present in their training data. This is particularly useful for domain-specific knowledge, personal data, or up-to-date information.

GloriaMundo aims to provide a seamless way for users to leverage their own documents to enhance their conversations with various AI models.
